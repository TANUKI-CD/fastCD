# fastCD multiplication benchmark

Host: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6148 CPU @ 2.40GHz (x86_64); gcc 16.2.1 20260810; 24 blocks of 10000 pairs per dimension; each cell is the mean over blocks of ns per product with a two-sided 95% Student-t interval.

Batch mode times one validated batch call per corpus pass (two products per SIMD instruction where the build supports it); single mode times one validated single-product call per pair.  Python object overhead is excluded. Verification uses an independent float64 oracle, not an exact product. Fastest names the lowest verified mean, or a tie when the paired-ratio interval of the two lowest means contains one; default is the library's automatic selection for that mode.

Seed: 20260906; CPU: 12; status: ok. Commit: unknown (not a git checkout). Build options, source and executable hashes, corpus hashes, and raw observations are in the accompanying JSON.

## Batch products (ns per product)

| N | direct | cariow_cariowa | quasilinear | fastest mean | default |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 56.25 [55.44, 57.06] | 51.84 [50.83, 52.85] | 56.60 [55.80, 57.40] | cariow_cariowa | cariow_cariowa |

## Single products (ns per product)

| N | direct | cariow_cariowa | quasilinear | fastest mean | default |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 82.89 [81.92, 83.86] | 116.80 [115.01, 118.59] | 112.54 [110.57, 114.51] | direct | direct |

## Paired ratios against quasilinear, batch mode

Geometric mean of per-block ratios (competitor / quasilinear) with 95% interval; values above 1 mean quasilinear was faster.

| N | direct / quasilinear | cariow_cariowa / quasilinear |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 16 | 0.994 [0.974, 1.015] (15/24 blocks faster) | 0.916 [0.893, 0.939] (23/24 blocks faster) |

## Paired ratios against quasilinear, single mode

Geometric mean of per-block ratios (competitor / quasilinear) with 95% interval; values above 1 mean quasilinear was faster.

| N | direct / quasilinear | cariow_cariowa / quasilinear |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 16 | 0.737 [0.721, 0.753] (24/24 blocks faster) | 1.038 [1.012, 1.065] (6/24 blocks faster) |

## Single-product time relative to batched time

Geometric mean of per-block ratios (single / batch) for each algorithm; values above 1 mean batching was faster.

| N | direct | cariow_cariowa | quasilinear |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 1.474 [1.448, 1.500] | 2.254 [2.207, 2.301] | 1.988 [1.939, 2.038] |

## Verification against the defining recursion

Maximum norm-scaled coordinate error |actual - oracle| / (||x|| ||y||) over the verified pairs, and mismatches against the tolerance 128 eps N, for each mode.

| N | direct | cariow_cariowa | quasilinear |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | batch: 4.08e-16 (0/10000); single: 4.08e-16 (0/10000) | batch: 3.88e-16 (0/10000); single: 3.88e-16 (0/10000) | batch: 5.48e-16 (0/10000); single: 5.48e-16 (0/10000) |
